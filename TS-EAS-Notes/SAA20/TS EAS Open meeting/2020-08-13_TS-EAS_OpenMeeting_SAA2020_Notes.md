See also the presentation named [2020-08-13_TS-EAS_Slidedeck.pdf](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/blob/master/TS-EAS-Notes/SAA20/TS%20EAS%20Open%20meeting/2020-08-13_TS-EAS_Slidedeck.pdf) for the meeting


#### Short introduction to TS EAS and what we been up to from Karin and Mark



*   Mark introduced the meeting and the housekeeping rules. The meeting is a fully open meeting where all attending are encouraged to give comments and ask questions.
*   Karin then presented the members of TS EAS and that work will begin on making the international membership application process following the SAA application process.
*   Our email list hosted by the Library of Congress has 1197 members spanning 37 countries and during the last year a total of 92, 169 emails were sent.
*   Work is on-going with our handbook [https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/wiki](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/wiki) where information about the TS and our work procedures can be found.
*   During the last year we have been working with models that will ease our work. One of these documents is the “Schema Design Principles” where the principles for the schemas are given. In the creation process we have also decided that the element and attributes in the schemas are named using camel casing. There has also been a publication model designed for the schemas to smoothen the process and lessen the manual work. 


#### EAC-CPF revision from Silke



*   Teamlead Silke started with an overview of EAC-CPF release history. Then the on-going revision which is on-going and can be followed via the team notes [https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/tree/master/eaccpf-subteam](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/tree/master/eaccpf-subteam) and GitHub issues [https://github.com/SAA-SDT/eac-cpf-schema/issues](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/eac-cpf-schema/issues) . 
*   The revision has a number of targets including the community requests for an easier and updated Tag Library where it's possible to see use cases and that the standard itself needs to have a simpåler encoding to make it easier to use. There is also a reconciliation on-going with EAD where alignment and making sure that having the same names mean the same thing is described and that it have the same model. There is also a big work going on with the control section making it easier to use and to be the same in all EAS standards.
*   Names have gotten remodeled and changed encoding. The dates are going to be followed with a best practice guideline for date encoding showing all the possible ways of using the dates.
*   The relations part of EAC-CPF is totally remodeled and all relations are going to be described with one element, you link to an entity of some sort and give the type of entity, role of relation, date and place of relation. There is also added the possibility to link to vocabularies.
*   Assertions will be added mainly via references to source, maintenance event & convention declaration in control area. This addition gives that there have been added repeatability of elements in some places to be able to give the assertions.
*   The documentation being previously only a tag library will be extended with a best practice guide. The guide will contain use cases and recommendations. We would like to encourage YOU as a user to aid us with examples to make the tag library and guide more usable.
*   Examples from the community is needed to enhance the work! We need examples showing special, tricky, rare issues. We need examples of &lt;span> in EAC-CPF and &lt;emph> in EAD to understand the use of them!
*   The goal is to release the “Request For Comments” RFC in December this year which tentatively mean release next year. One of the factors making it not easy to give an exact timeline is that the work in TS EAS is made by voluntary workers spread around the world.


#### EAD and upcoming revision from Kerstin



*   Team lead Kerstin started with an overview of the for EAD implemented rolling revision cycle covering the minor and major issues submitted which will be used by all the EAS standards. (A full revision is following other rules.)
    *   August-> January collecting input
    *   February -> April review of input
    *   May/June RFC on the suggested updates
    *   July/August implementation of the updates
    *   Release of next version next annual meeting
*   During the year there were released an EAD3 1.1.1 Patch release covering bug fixes for &lt;c12>, &lt;foreign> in &lt;ref> and &lt;objectxmlwrap> in XSD deliverables and updates to tag libraries
*   Work is on-going with the reconciliation already introduced by Silke.To note is that the changes will first be seen in EAC-CPF and then in EAD in the future versions.
*   EAD needs to look into a major revision and it will start with a number of administrative steps following the procedure from SAA. After approval of starting the revision a 3 year working period until release is foreseen. Material already collected like the EAD survey and the EAS section survey will be used. The revision will make sure to engage with the community through for example follow-up surveys and webinars.


#### Outreach from Adrian and Cory



*   The TS EAS outreach team is a new formed team led by Adrian and Cory with a focus on community engagement related to the TS EAS standards.
*   The team aims for connection with other SAA sections which means there are a number of liaisons. There are also connections outside of SAA being established.
*   The team will engage in promotion, education, outreach related to the standards of TS EAS.
*   The team kicked off its events with two on-line webinar introducing the TS EAS work made by the two co-chairs to learn the Zoom principles to use.
*   There are a number of things planned:
    *   Webinars
        *   Update on roadmaps
            *   EAC-CPF revision
            *   RiC
        *   Planning for more webinars in fall and winter
            *   More details on EAC-CPF
            *   Coordinate ICA to host an update on RiC
    *   Video tutorials which will be posted to SAA youtube channel
        *   Submitting EAS feature/bug/issue request
        *   Simple strategies  and free tools for validating and fixing EAD files (EAD on a shoestring)
        *   Introduction to EAC-CPF 
        *   Overview of the continuous EAS revision cycle
*   The team want to be here for the community and address community needs related to interpreting and implementing standards developing material in close collaboration with other sections.
*   The Outreach team wants your feedback on the resources needed for you to be able to use the EAS standards!
*   Feedback from the meeting attendances gave that EAD on a shoestring is a great idea since in the universities they have access to things like the tool oxyGen, but elsewhere may need free tools and lack of tools is a barrier.


#### General Q and A



*   Mark asked if there is interest in TS EAS hosting a validation web tool for EAC-CPF and EAD? And there were positive answers to that.
*   For the outreach a comment was given that to think about it as being similar to professional writing and editing a chapter together, so TS EAS could have sessions to work in-depth with specific aspects of work.
*   Feedback was given that it’s good to increase collaboration and work with other sections.
*   A question was asked regarding often will TS-EAS meet or send communications?
    *   There will be outreach performed to inform about webinars, etc but there is no firm schedule set up so far. TS eAS want it to be ongoing program.
    *   The TS EAS Subteams meet at least once a month which means the TS EAS has meetings every week in some form.
    *   The whole TS EAS has one fully open meeting a year where all who want to can attend at the SAA Annual conference but also meet in between 3 times.
*   A question was asked regarding how I can become a member of TS EAS?
    *   SAA member: Apply through the call for members that are published in the archival outlook magazine.
    *   Internationally: A call will go out after the procedure has become more formalized during this fall.

The meeting was ended by a big thank you to all who attended!
