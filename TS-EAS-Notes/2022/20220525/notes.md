        * Dates and ISO 8601:2019 Parts 1 and 2
            * Mark gave an overview of the subject
            * The suggestion is to:
                * We adopt the Extended format exclusively (e.g. 2022-05-25)
                * We keep the implicit format (no need to use Y, M, D, or add C, J, G, etc., in the strings)
                * We consider adding time support (but likely won’t need this until the next version of EAD)
                * We add support for the new EDTF qualifications from Part 2, but only: ?, %, ~, and X
                    * 200X-05-25
                    * 2002?-05-25
                * We add support for seasons / sub-year groupings, e.g.
                    * 2022-32  = Summer in the Southern Hemisphere, 2022
                * We exclude everything else, such as durations, ranges, significant digits for dates, leap seconds, etc., etc.
            * Suggestion supported by email from Kerstin
            * Please share any examples of “difficult” dates currently in EAD and EAC-CPF!
                * Glenn will aid with examples from LC and also check if they have validation of these types of dates.
            * Let the Schema Team know if there are any concerns about the proposed profile / subset of ISO:8601 2019 that we are looking to adopt
            * Before our next meeting, we will share updated copies of our schematron files for everyone to test
