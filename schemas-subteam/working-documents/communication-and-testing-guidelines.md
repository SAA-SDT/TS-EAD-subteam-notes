#Communication and Testing Guidelines

###Communication Principles
Committee minutes and documentation will be posted to the SAA TS-EAS's Github organizational account.

In order to ensure an open and transparent schema development process, all discussions of bugs and feature requests will be conducted within Github's issue tracker.

(fill out the rest of the details as needed, once we start handling the first few pull requests for the EAD3 schema)
