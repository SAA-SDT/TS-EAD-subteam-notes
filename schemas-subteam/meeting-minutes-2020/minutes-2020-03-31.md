## Issues referred to Schema team from EAC-CPF revision meeting in Berlin
- Final decision whether to remove the XML namespace, see https://github.com/SAA-SDT/eac-cpf-schema/issues/27
  - What is it that we gain by having the XML namespace in EAC-CPF?
  - What would be the "risk" in removing it?
  - Document decision in issue #27
- Introduction of Schematron to EAC-CPF
  - Results from decision to set up &lt;control> in the same way as in EAD3
  - Check which ISO standards to use (e.g. choose language codes that are most supportive with regard to accessibility) and where there are detailed definitions in (one of) the schemas at the moment (e.g. @standarddatetime for &lt;eventdatetime> in EAD3 limits the values to a maximum of 2099 for the year part)
- Technical options to deal with different content models of shared elements, e.g. EAD3 elements that use m.mixed.basic vs. EAC-CPF elements that only have TEXT or, maybe, &lt;span>  
  - Dealing with the differences only at the point of publishing the respective schema files, but defining both EAS in the same way
  - Exploring the option to allow users to include XHTML instead
    - Might go along with exploring the option to allow users to add their own attributes
- The use of @localtype
  - Question referred to the Schema Team: is there a good argument to not allow @localtype within &lt;control>? Or could it be within &lt;control> as well as within &lt;...desc(ription)> / &lt;relations>?
  - Question referred to TS-EAS as a whole (May meeting): change back from @localtype to @type as well as reverting back from context-specific @...type attributes?
    - Follow-up question for the Schema Team (depending on the decision made at the May meeting): if we keep context-specific @...type attributes, do we agree to establish a design principle that these would always need to come with a predefined values list?
