## Agenda / Minutes

### Updates
- Karin reported about XML Prague, where she asked for advice about any frameworks for schema testing.
- Turns out, there are none...
- Someone suggested using XSpec https://github.com/xspec, though, for our XSLT files and Schematron files.
- We'll investigate more about XSpec, and talk about it with Terry on our next call.
- (aside: Saturday the 10th marked XML's 20th birthday)
- Regine has added two more EAD3 documents for testing, complete with new data based on the changes for 1.1
- Still working on some EAC-CPF documents, and we'll add those later this year.

### Schema Maintenance Proposal
- Mark will send to Karen and Kathy by 5 p.m. EST today. Please make any other edits, comments, etc., before then if you have them.

### Old Business
EAD3 issue 515 https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/515
- Regine will comment on this ticket, tagging Terry. This is really beyond our scope, though.

EAC-CPF issue 36 https://github.com/SAA-SDT/eac-cpf-schema/issues/36 
- Mark will comment on this ticket and close it out.

### New Business
- Regine:  maybe the following issue should be re-opened?
https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/140.  We'll discuss on the next call; may need to pass it over to the EAD3 group.
