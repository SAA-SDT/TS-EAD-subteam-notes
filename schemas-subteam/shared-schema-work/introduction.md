# Shared Schema 

Investigation into the option of a shared schema for all EAS formats, has initially been carried out by an Ad hoc Working 
Group, the repository of which can be found here: https://github.com/SAA-SDT/SharedSchema. 

The group reported on their findings during the TS-EAS meeting on 2 August 2019 
(see report here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOweYvPolqVBAkJhLFzxIHxqQdtIOJAPS18dGI7IBRk/edit?usp=sharing), when it 
was decided that the work will be continued by the Schemas subteam.
