# Update from the EAS Schema subteam

## Team Membership

August 2017 â€“ August 2018:
- Karin Bredenberg (liaison)
- Terry Catapano
- Mark Custer (chair)
- Regine Heberlein

## Current Status

All meeting minutes and documentation continue to be provided on the TS-EAS Github site at <https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/tree/master/schemas-subteam>

Since the Society of American Archivist's annual meeting, the Schemas group has had 5 conference calls.

Most importantly, we prepared a new release of [EAD3 1.1](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/releases/tag/v1.1.2-beta) for testing in November, which went out for comment in January, thanks to the EAD Subgroup.


## Initatives Underway

We are [proposing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNvdOet-Q6-u_K1K8kBd4qPqXRJNn54r054e4b72uO8/edit?usp=sharing "Draft Proposal on Google Drive") that, moving forward, TS-EAS maintain RNG and XSD versions of XML-based schemas for both EAD3 and EAC-CPF, as well as continue to provide the DTD with EAD3.

We are also:
- Preparing for the EAC revision. 
- Updating our local testing suite of EAD3 and EAC-CPF records
- Still planning to come up with other ways to work with TS-EAS schemas, including some guideance about Schematron and how to make a local profile of a schema.



## Forthcoming projects/initiatives

We will review our current policies and practices to see what can be improved during the schema update process (e.g. does EAD3 1.1 have useful comments embedded directly in the new schemas that document the new features adequately?), which will be especially useful during the EAC-CPF revision.
