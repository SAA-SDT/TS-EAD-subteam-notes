# Update from the EAS Schema subteam

## Team Membership

- Kerstin Arnold
- Karin Bredenberg (liaison)
- Mark Custer (chair)
- Alexander Duryee
- Iris Lee
- Eric Sonnenberg (Standards liaison)

## Current Status

This year, the Schema Team:

- released the EAC-CPF 2.0 draft schema and tag library;
- developed of a new, experimental EAS online validation service (hosted on GitHub Pages);
- created an EAC 1.x to 2.0 XSLT transformation process;
- released an updated Tag Library, with new e-ISBN, for EAD3 1.1.1;
- updated our Schema Design principles based on discussion from February all-member meeting;
- sunset the EAD 2002 schema, according to our recently-updated Design Principles.

Since our last TS-EAS meeting on 2021-05-14, we have had one team meeting, on June 8. At that time, we decided to hold off on determining our standing meeting time for next year until after we welcome new members to the team.

## Initiatives Underway

- Develop the new Best Practice Guide infrastructure (led by Iris)
- Update the Schematron file used by EAD/EAC (we still need to write new rules for ISO-8601 2019, once we have that standard in hand, as well as to add back in the external code validation rules)


## Forthcoming projects/initiatives

- Update the new Schema publication process to include automatic testing, using GitHub actions
- Finish adding EAD3 to the new publication process / repository
- Update the TS-EAS handbook
