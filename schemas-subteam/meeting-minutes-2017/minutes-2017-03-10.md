# Minutes, 2017-03-10
Time: 9 a.m. EST / 3 p.m. CET

## Attendees
- Karin
- Terry
- Mark
- Mike

## Notes
- Mike asked for feedback from TS-EAS on the EAD3 proposed updates (4 new features requested, and 2 bug fixes); deadline for comment is March 20th. Next up will be an open comment period (about a month long)
- This means we should be able to get EAD 3.1 shipped and released before SAA's annual meeting
- Schema output responsibilities discussion:
	- Discussed whether we need to release a DTD for version 3.1 (EAD3 promised one for the first release, but EAC doesn't have one at all), but the group still hasn't come up for a recommendation about this to take to TS-EAS yet.
	- Terry noted that there are limits to what can be documented in the RNG to DTD transformation (and that you have to write the RELAX NG schema in a certain way to enable migration to DTD); Terry also noted that he might actually prefer to drop XSD support, but that there is still some value there due to how that version of the schema can be referenced in METS.
	- For this first release, we'll produce all 3 schema outputs before making any recommendations for future releases.
- Confirmed that we don't have anything yet to discuss about EAG and EAF
- EAC-CPF update recommendations will be added to Github shortly
- Karin also noted that the issue template is now live at SAA's website: [http://www2.archivists.org/standards/TS-EAS-report-an-issue]
- Next meeting:  4/21, 9 a.m. EST

## Action Items:
- Before the next call, Mark will experiment with generating all three schemas for EAD 3.1, making notes along the way; he'll ask Terry questions via Github as he runs into obstacles
- Mark will send out a meeting propsal from Outlook for the April meeting, rather than just an email reminder.
