  - Suggestion to use ODD for schema and tag library maintenance.
    - example: [https://github.com/ParthenosWP4/standardsLibrary/blob/master/archivalDescription/EAD/odd/EADSpec.xml]
    - Discussed this at length, but given the amount of work involved, decided not to pursue it presently.
    - Also discussed the barrier involved already in updating the TEI tag library
  - Proposal on schemas that we're committed to support moving forward for both EAD3 and EAC-CPF (and others, like EAG/F, if needed)
  - Any other issues / ideas / etc. for the new year
- Schedule our next meeting:
  - Scheduled for 11/17, 10 a.m. EST, but still need to check if that will work with Noah.  If not, we might postpone the next meeting.    


### to do:
- Mark: for next meeting, invite Noah.
- Mark / Regine: write up official readme for generating rng, dtd, and xsd files for both regular and undeprecated (though hopefully this is the last time we'll provide the undeprecated versions). After comment period closes,  merge 3.1 develop branch (then delete) with master and remove working files from "inprocess" directory. Target date: end of December.
- Mike: close out open Github issues (e.g. 508) after reviewing them. Target date: end of November.
- Terry: review branches in Github and delete as required.  Target date: end of November.
- All: test new EAD3 1.1 candidate release.
