## Notes
- Mike hasn't had a chance to test the new schemas yet, but he did hear back from Noah that once we have a release candidate ready for EAD3 1.1, Noah will be help with testing.
- Mark didn't have a chance to created the undprecated schemas yet for 1.1, but he'll do that today, as well as create a release in Github. See [https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/releases/tag/v1.1.0-beta]
- Terry mentioned that we should create two branches: one that we'll eventually merge into master, and the other for the candidate release.
- We still need to get something out to the commmunity about Schematron 
- Sounds like June 9th will work for our next meeting, and Mark will confirm that later today by sending out a meeting request.
