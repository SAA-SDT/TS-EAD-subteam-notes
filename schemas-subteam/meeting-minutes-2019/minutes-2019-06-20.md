# Minutes, 2019-06-20
Time: 9 a.m. EST / 3 p.m. CET

## Attendees
- Karin
- Mark

## Agenda / Minutes
- New update for EAD3 issue: https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/tree/issue_522
- Next steps for adopting the DILCIS Board GitHub intro: https://github.com/DILCISBoard/DILCISBoard.github.io
- Shared schema brainstorming (technical aspects)
There are a variety of options for how we might manage this (especially when it comes to namespaces, etc.), but we'll hold off on setting anything up until after the committee had made a decision about whether to pursue the shared schema approach or not.


## Action items
- Karin will convert Mark into an "owner" so that he can create a new repository to house that documentation.
- Mark will use the DILCIS readme files, updating the screenshots. We'll also add a "thank you" and attribution link back to the DILCISBoard repository.
- After that, the schema subteam will work on updating the two schema-related repositories so that they adhere to our new guidelines.
