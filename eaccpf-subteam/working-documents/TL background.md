## Background

[...]
[...] In 2011, the Working Group was disbanded and SAA Council approved a charge to form the Technical Subcommittee for Encoded Archival Context (TS-EAC). In 2015 the Technical Subcommittees on EAD and EAC-CPF were merged to form the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival Standards (TS-EAS), responsible for the ongoing maintenance of EAD and EAC-CPF.

Archival description includes information about the content, intellectual and physical
attributes of the archival material, as well as information about the context of their
creation and use. The contextual information of the creation and use of material is
often complex and multi-layered and may involve individuals, families, organizations,
societies, functions, activities, business processes, geographic places, events, and other
entities. Primary among these entities are the corporate bodies, persons and families
(CPF entities) responsible for the creation or use of material, usually organizations or
persons. With information about these CPF entities, users can understand and interpret
the records more fully since they will know the context within which the CPF entities
operated and created and/or used the material. Information about these CPF entities
can be used either as a component within descriptive approaches that fully integrate
contextual information into descriptive products, as archives have traditionally done, or
as an independent system that is linked to other descriptive systems and products that
focus on content.

Encoded Archival Context â€“ Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF)
primarily addresses the description of individuals, families and corporate bodies that
create, preserve, use, and are responsible for and/or associated with records in a variety
of ways. Over time, other types of contextual entities may evolve under the larger
EAC umbrella, but currently its primary purpose is to standardize the encoding of
descriptions about CPF entities to enable the sharing, discovery and display of this
information in an electronic environment. It supports the linking of information about
one CPF entities to other CPF entities to show/discover the relationships amongst
record-creating entities and the linking to descriptions of records and other contextual
entities.

EAC-CPF is a communication structure for archival contextual information for
individuals, corporate bodies and families and thereby supports the exchange of
ISAAR(CPF) compliant authority records. ISAAR(CPF) "determines the types of
information that could be included in an archival authority record and provides
guidance on how such records may be deployed in an archival descriptive system."
ISAAR(CPF) also notes that "[s]uccessful automated exchange of archival authority
information over computer networks is dependent upon the adoption of a suitable
communication format by the repositories involved in the exchange. Encoded
Archival Context (EAC) is one such communication format which supports the
exchange of ISAAR(CPF) compliant archival authority data over the World Wide
Web" (ISAAR(CPF), 2004, p. 12). EAC-CPF provides a mechanism for enabling the
full expression of ISAAR(CPF), however it may also contain some additional elements
or technical content not contained within ISAAR(CPF).
Based upon the Toronto Tenets, established in 2001, the following have informed the
development of the schema:
