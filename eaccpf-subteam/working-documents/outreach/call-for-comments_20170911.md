Subject: Revision of Encoded Archival Context – Corporate Bodies, Persons, Families – Call for Comments

[Apologies for cross-posting.]

At the annual meeting in Portland, Oregon this year, the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival Description (TS-EAS) of the Society of American Archivists agreed to undertake a revision of the standard EAC-CPF.

The subcommittee is calling for proposed changes to the current version of EAC-CPF. To ensure the greatest possible input from users of EAC-CPF and other relevant standards, the deadline for change proposals is 11 December 2017. At that time, all proposals will be made publicly available through the EAC-CPF GitHub portal (https://github.com/SAA-SDT/eac-cpf-schema/issues). 

Please send feedback and comments by e-mail to Silke Jagodzinski (s.jagodzinski@bundesarchiv.de). To ensure that the revision process is as open as possible, all comments must be attributable to named individuals and affiliated organisations where appropriate. Anonymous responses will not be considered. All change proposals will be made publicly available, with attribution, through the GitHub Portal as established during the EAD revision process. E-mail addresses are asked for so that we may contact respondents for clarification, but will not be shared.
