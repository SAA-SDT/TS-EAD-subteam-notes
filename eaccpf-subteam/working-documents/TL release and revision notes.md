## Release and Revision Notes

This is the final release of the Tag Library for EAC-CPF 2010. The previous release,
published in 2010, had the status of draft. The current release represents a thorough
revision undertaken by the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival Context
reflecting comments received by the international community of professionals.
The EAC-CPF Tag Library is a living document. As such, it will continue to be
developed as users suggest areas in need of clarification or expansion. The Technical
Subcommittee for Encoded Archival Context (TS-EAC encourages implementers
to provide any queries, comments, and suggestions regarding the tag library and its
content. In addition, the contribution of examples is highly encouraged. Questions,
comments or examples may be directed to the EAC-CPF Tag Library Editor and
co-Chair of the TS-EAC, Katherine M. Wisser (wisser [at] simmons.edu). The
underlying encoding of the Tag Library is based on TEI P5 and is designed to facilitate
incorporating documentation into the schema to provide guidance in XML editors.
While the initial release of the Tag Library is in English, the underlying encoding is
designed to facilitate providing the Tag Library in additional languages at later dates.
