## Release and Revision Notes

This is the release of the Tag Library for EAC-CPF 2010 revised. The current release includes changes and updates in the schema undertaken by the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival Standards reflecting comments received by the international community of professionals. The EAC-CPF Tag Library is a living document. As such, it will continue to be developed as users suggest areas in need of clarification or expansion. The Technical Subcommittee for Encoded Archival Standards (TS-EAS) still encourages implementers to provide any queries, comments, and suggestions regarding the tag library and its content. In addition, the contribution of examples is highly encouraged. Questions, comments or examples may be directed to the EAC-CPF subgroup lead, Silke Jagodzinski (s.jagodzinski[at]bundesarchiv.de) or the co-Chair of the TS-EAS, Katherine M. Wisser (wisser [at] simmons.edu). The underlying encoding of the Tag Library is based on TEI P5 and is designed to facilitate
incorporating documentation into the schema to provide guidance in XML editors. While the initial release of the Tag Library is in English, the underlying encoding is designed to facilitate providing the Tag Library in additional languages at later dates.
