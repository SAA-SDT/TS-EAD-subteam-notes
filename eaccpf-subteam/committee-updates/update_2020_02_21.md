# EAC-CPF team report

Virt. TS-EAS meeting, 21 Feb 2020

**Team membership**

Since our last report in August 2019 the EAC-CPF team changed in detail:

- Ailie Smith is our new tag library editor
- Erica Boudreau, Kathy Wisser and Regine Heberlein left TS-EAS and EAC-CPF team
- new EAC-CPF team members are Caitlin Rizzo and Lina Bountouri
- Clint Johnson joint the team, but left due to personal reasons in January 2020

**Current status**

During SAA19, we had a full meeting day to discuss EAC-CPF revision topics. The meeting was attended by 5 team members, we discusses 4 topics. We also agreed to create a Best Practise Guide next to the Tag Library to explain the encoding for specific use cases.

1. Names: we started to discuss the communities request on names encoding in Austin and finalised details for a modified encoding during the following monthly virtual meetings, cf. [Topic\_names\_20200130.pdf](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/blob/master/eaccpf-subteam/working-documents/topics/names/Topic_names_20200130.pdf).

2. Assertion description: In Austin, we started to discuss a first draft to encode assertions in EAC-CPF and went on to discuss details during the monthly virtual meetings. A third draft of the document is under construction and will be discussed and finalised during our next face-to-face meeting in Berlin, March 2020.

3. Dates: we finalised our discussion on best practise of date encoding in our meeting in Austin, [cf. Topic\_dates.pdf](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/blob/master/eaccpf-subteam/working-documents/topics/dates/Topic_dates.pdf). Results will end up in our Best Practise Guide. Until today, there is no encoding change needed.

4. Identifiers: At the meeting in Austin, we identified different kinds of identifiers and their usage, [cf. Topic_identifiers.pdf](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/blob/master/eaccpf-subteam/working-documents/topics/identifiers/Topic_identifiers.pdf). Most of the results will end up in our Best Practise Guide. Some details are still open issues and will be discussed during our next face-to-face meeting in Berlin, March 2020.

The team also started to work on EAD3 Reconciliation and a shared schema approach, esp. by defining common elements and attributes. There was also a combined virtual EAD-Schema-EAC-team meeting end of January 2020.

**Initiatives underway**

Our next milestone is a four days face-to-face meeting in Berlin, GER, between 9 and 12 March 2020. The team is preparing this meeting since November 2019.

There are 3 big topics to discuss in Berlin: EAD3 Reconciliation, Relations in EAC-CPF and Documentation. Next to that, we are going to talk about RiC-CM, RiC-O and the usage of schemas and ontologies.

Also connected with the revision, we started to create on GitHub issue per element and attribute to summarise the change requests and prepare a tool to create the schema files, tag library and the best practise guidelines.

**Forthcoming projects/initiatives desired, priorities**

The target is still to finalise EAC-CPF revision in 2020. Publishing the call for comments, discuss, and include the feedback, a release is possible in 2021.
