Since beginning this year we are going to have monthly virtual meetings with the eac-cpf team (see sub team notes).

So far we identified 19 issues to solve for the planned minor update, also called phase 1. Schema needs to be changed for 15 issues and becomes eac-cpf 2010_revised at the end. The tag library also has to be changed for 4 more issues.

Kathy & Erica worked on an EAC-CPF â€“ EAD3 comparison. The table might be checked for quick fixes for phase 1, but most issues will be discussed for the revision.
