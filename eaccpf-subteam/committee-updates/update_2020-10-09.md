**Team membership**

With the new term beginning in August, two new members joined the EAC-CPF team:

* Sara Schliep
* Iris Lee

**Current status, since October 2020**

After a quite exhausting extra virtual meeting during the SAA Annual Meeting pre-conference in August 2020, monthly virtual EAC-CPF team meetings went on. 

Most topics on EAD3-Reconciliation were solved during the reported period and last pending issues are tackled. The upcoming Call for Comments is in preparation.

**Initiatives underway**

Finalising last pending issues and decisions and beginning to create the schema files (xsd rng) and the Tag Library draft.

**Forthcoming projects/initiatives desired, priorities**

The next major milestone is the Call for Comments planned to be published in December 2020 with a duration of 3 month, therefore until end of March 2021. Any other schedule and planning will be discussed, once the Call for Comments is online.
