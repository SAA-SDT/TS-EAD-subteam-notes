# TS-EAS Subteam Charge: Outreach and Communications
Approved: December 16, 2019
 

## Scope and role of the Outreach and Communications team
The scope/role of this team represents a refactored charge for the former Documentation team. The focus of the Outreach and Communications team is to promote broader awareness of TS-EAS' activities and its work plans, across a range of key stakeholders and audiences.

In addition to coordinating closely with other TS-EAS teams, the Outreach and Communications team would liaise with the Encoded Archival Standards (EAS) Section leadership on communications, education, and outreach plans.

## Key stakeholders/audiences
- Archivists and staff at cultural heritage organizations that are responsible for implementing encoded archival standards
- Aggregators that support encoded archival standards
- Developers of products/tools that support encoded archival standards
- Translators of encoded archival standards

## Areas of responsibility 
- Update TS-EAS microsite, and coordinate updates to other SAA sites where relevant (e.g., Standards Portal) with reference resources, news items, announcements, etc., with input from other TS-EAS teams. Explore options for posting information about significant TS-EAS milestones/outputs to broader library, archive, and museum venues.
- Schedule, coordinate, and host occasional webinars highlighting TS-EAS-related work.
- Coordinate with leadership on other related SAA Sections (e.g., EAS Section Chair/Co-Chair, and Collection Management Section Chair/Co-Chair) on communications and outreach strategy. Prepare and post periodic updates to those sections' mailing lists and newsletters.
- Cultivate an ongoing dialogue with aggregators and developers/vendors of commonly-used archival collection management systems to understand pain points with implementing and supporting updates to encoded archival standards.
- Establish workflows with Web liaisons at the Library of Congress and Staatsbibliotek for site updates, including links to translations, and engage the Web liaisons on the team in ongoing maintenance work.
- Liaise with external groups providing translations of EAS tag libraries.
