  - Survey to be presented on SAA Zoom account, which is limited to 100 participants (we may not know if people are turned away once that number is reached)
    - Based on feedback and experience, may need to look at other platforms in the future 
    - Zoom policies recently changed to require Felicia (or the account owner) to let people into the room, will need to be tested in advance
  - Survey will be available through Survey Monkey
  - This webinar is a way to review procedures, meant to streamline future webinars
    - May need to look at distribution channels for next time--were able to get on some listservs this time that may not be available in the future
  - Post-webinar -- will send announcement with link to YouTube video
- Next webinar plans
  - Future possibilities include EAC-CPF development and roll-out (after draft is out for review, late fall 2020)

  - Short presentations/walk-throughs related to EAS standards development
    - EAS revision process
    - Communicating through GitHub (bug reports, change requests, other contributions)
  - Proposal information available in Google Drive account 
  - Webinar development is not based on same schedule as webinars, flexible
  - Comments about content can be made in the document, and scripts can be circulated for review as they are developed -- please review / provide feedback by 4/29
- Updating TS-EAS subteam directory on GitHub; post charge there
  - Posting our team's meeting minutes? We'll continue using Google Docs for our internal team notes, but post a modified version to GitHub
  - SAA microsite should just point out to the GitHub locations, rather than including updates in microsite
      - Charge could also go in the wiki page for the technical subcommittee, (https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/wiki/Sub-Teams-and-Charges)
- Translations statement / linking to handbook 
  - Guidelines for translations now available in the Handbook, (https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/wiki/Translation-of-Tag-Libriaries)
  - Draft statement prepared for the LC and Staatsbibliotek website, should be ready for posting
- SAA microsite update planning
  - Work continuing in planning -- general sense that microsite should be cleaned up, streamlined with GitHub content
