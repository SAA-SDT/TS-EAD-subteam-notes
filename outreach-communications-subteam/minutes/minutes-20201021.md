    - Circulate online resource dev spreadsheet to TS-EAS; suggestions for tabs 2-4 (with context re: survey)
  - Section education planning and SAA Education discussion
    - Action item: If there are other questions that should be asked, they should be added to the list
    - Not sure if this will be a call or just questions sent in by e-mail for a response
  - Records in Contexts (Daniel Pitti / Adrian)
    - Currently waiting on Daniel
  - EAC-CPF draft rollout (Silke Jagodzinski / Cory)
    - Not ready to schedule yet, but will likely be in new year (Jan.-Feb.?)
    - Would also be good to plan for an office hours opportunity in conjunction with the webinar--maybe topically-based series?
  - EAD3 implementation case studies / looking ahead to EAD4 (TBD)
    - Had meant to happen after the EAC-CPF webinar, but could be before a formal call for comments on EAD revision
    - Could also look at breaking these into two sessions--one on EAD3 implementation survey (https://www.loc.gov/ead/EAD3_Implementation_Survey_Results_and_Discussion_20190320.pdf) and case studies, and one looking forward at development roadmap
    - For EAD3 portion, would be good to include information on the status of systems support for the standard (e.g., software developers, EAD aggregators, etc.)
    - Action item: Michele will check with EAS Section SC to ask for a volunteer to lead development/programming of an EAD3 implementation case study webinar
- Tutorial updates
  - EAD on a Shoestring (Michele Combs)
    - Current draft here, comments welcome!
    - Leaning towards at least 2 different tutorials: tools roundup, and one working through a specific use case (e.g., making a tweak to an EAD file)
  - EAS Primer (Kathy Wisser)
    - Action item: Meeting next Wednesday to discuss. Please add comments/structural feedback on how to improve--particularly for international collection management tools, standards implementations
  - EAS Revision Cycle (Noah Huffman)
    - No updates, waiting for Standards committee decision on major/minor
    - Council meets in November, hopefully will decide on status then
