# Annual Calendar for Managing Minor Revisions to Standards maintained by TS-EAS

## Preamble
The Annual Calendar for Managing Minor Revisions to Standards maintained by TS-EAS has been created with EAD3 in mind at a time, when EAC-CPF has been undergoing a major revision. It is, however, the intent of TS-EAS to apply this calendar to all current and future standards under TS-EAS' purview, as long as they are not currently undergoing a major revision.

## August - December
- Open period for community and TS-EAS to discuss feature requests or other change requests submitted for consideration in the next annual release.
- Submissions should follow the templates provided in the relevant GitHub repositories, e.g. https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/new for EAD3, and include justification for how the change will benefit the standard more broadly.
- Alternatively, submissions can be made via the TS-EAS webform at https://www2.archivists.org/standards/TS-EAS-report-an-issue
- The appropriate team of TS-EAS will review and evaluate requests as they are received, seek additional information when necessary, and conduct discussion of requests in GitHub issue threads.
- Where necessary, the team may seek broader community input on particular change requests via the EAD listserv and other outlets, especially with regard to requests that could potentially lead to major changes.

## December 31
- Deadline for receiving feature requests for inclusion in annual release.
- Change requests received after this date may not be considered until the next release cycle.

## January
- The appropriate team of TS-EAS will issue a public call for community feedback on any feature requests that are under consideration for the current annual release. 
- Community members may submit feedback directly in GitHub. 
- Feedback submitted to TS-EAS by email or other channels will be posted to GitHub with attribution.

## February - April
- Based on the team's initial evaluation and proposals, TS-EAS as a whole will make an initial decision to accept or reject change requests based on the committees' evaluation and community feedback.
- Decisions will be made public in GitHub.
- TS-EAS may decide to postpone evaluation of a request to the next release cycle if the change request requires more discussion or additional community input.
- If there are no accepted change requests, TS-EAS may decide to forgo an annual release.
- If TS-EAS decides to issue a new release, it will clearly tag in GitHub which change requests (GitHub Issues) it intends to include in the upcoming annual release.
- TS-EAS will compile and submit the list of accepted change requests to the Standards Committee for approval.
- After Standards Committee approval, TS-EAS will coordinate the work required to implement change requests in the schemas and tag libraries.
- TS-EAS will iteratively test new code branches that include the changes.

## May - June
- The appropriate team of TS-EAS will issue a release candidate including the changes and solicit community testing and feedback.
- There will be a ~6 week comment period to solicit feedback on the changes that are included in the release candidate.
- Comments should be documented in GitHub issues and made visible to the community.
- TS-EAS may make additional changes to the schemas or tag libraries based on testing and feedback.
- TS-EAS will [update tag libraries](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/blob/master/UPDATING.md) to reflect any changes to the schema.

## July - August
- TS-EAS will finalize changes based on comments and testing and issue a new minor release (e.g. EAD3 v1.2.0). 
- Target dates for the annual release should coincide with SAA annual meeting where possible.
- The minor release will include release notes clearly documenting the changes included in the release.
- TS-EAS will notify Standards Committee of pending release in advance of public announcement.
- TS-EAS will finalize tag libraries and publish updated schemas and tag libraries in coordination with liaisons from Library of Congress and Standards Committee.
- TS-EAS will publicize availability of new release on EAD listserv and other appropriate outlets and issue a call for additional change requests for the next annual revision cycle.

### Exceptions

**Minor bug fixes or tag library changes may be reported / implemented outside of this review cycle. Such patches would then be approved within TS-EAS directly. 

**For major revisions that would have significant impacts on compatibility with the existing schemas, TS-EAS would conduct more extensive community review and seek approval from Standards Committee and SAA Council. TS-EAS may choose to postpone the annual minor revision cycle if a major revision is planned or underway.

___
### Release Numbering

**Minor revisions would follow these release numbering conventions: EAD3 v1.1.0 (new minor feature release), EAD3 v1.1.1 (bugfix release), EAD3 v1.1.3 (bugfix release), EAD3 v1.2.0 (new minor feature release), etc.
