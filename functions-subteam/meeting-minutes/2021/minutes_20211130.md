## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)

    * Walkthrough of the folders in the functions-incubator folder
        * “01 TS-EAS EAC-F team meetings and reports” contains notes and also powerpoints that have been used
        * “02 Feedback on Functions in RiC” contains discussion regarding RiC and functions
        * “2-acte-royal” and “03 XML Beta schemas from 2013 Ad hoc group meeting” contains the schemas that has been created
        * “04 Arguments on why we need an EAC-F schema” contains the “why’s” 
        * “05 Ad hoc group Compilation and examples” explanation of uses of functions
        * “06 Literature sources” contains sources and among those a summary made by Kathy Wisser.
        * “emails” contains emails that Joost have gotten on the subject of functions
        * “Meetings” contains meetings from 2021
        * “SAA 2018” contains the report that was part of the TS EAS meeting at SAA18.
    * The question is, what is a function and can it be shared with others? Functions are used in so many different ways, many originating in records management and retention schedules. In the archival setting it is used as a link between agents.
        * Read the arguments document to learn more about this.
    * Joost has written a paper on functions. It’s in Dutch, Google Translate might work. We will get access to it.
    * On the question; “Where to start?” Joost adivices us to start with looking at the new EAC-CPF schema and TL in combination with looking at the available examples. 
        * What are the elements?
        * What are the functions?
        * What do others do?
        * Which elements are relevant?
        * Purpose of a schema?
        * Harvest from a records management system or is it EAD?
    * Are there other schemas?
        * RiC
        * Information/Record Management
        * Information classification
        * EAC-CPF?
        * [https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAC-F/wiki](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAC-F/wiki) contains a list
    * Don't create something that won't be used!
        * Find the basics first!
        * After basics, maybe extend?!
    * ISDF itself is rather “loose” in defining where to be used. Its more do it.
    * Atom [https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) have parts integrated
    * Authorized forms of names on functions?
        * Well not really just sort of, look at whats present in information management.
        * Different sources => different names
        * And might even mean different things
    * Are the number of activities infinite?
        * Most likely not but it's the naming of them.
    * The border between information/records management and the archival description is easily crossed...
    * Depending on purpose, the function description needs to be more or less extensive and take into account the different practices that are used.
    * [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1474521](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1474521) some indication on where functions are used by looking at available translations
    * The European Archivist Group are working with a concept called Archiving by Design, where its more integrated into being functions and archival description in the system and transfer to the archive is still not really solved.
    * Keeping it simple might be is it a series in EAD or a description in EAC-CPF.
    * Big question what is functions and are there tools so it can be created?
    * Suggested roadmap for the work:
        * Evaluate EAC-CPF
        * The elements are already in both EAD and EAC-CPF, find them (see action points!)
* Action points
    * Joost to upload some more information to the Google Drive (Joost)
        * Access for Joost (Karin)
    * Find the elements that already exist for function, task to be ready by the next meeting.
        * Dia will deepen the look into the ISO standards with the aid of Joost’s thesis.
        * Elizabeth will look into RiC.
