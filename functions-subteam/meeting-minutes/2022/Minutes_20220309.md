## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Result from last meetings actions points
    * Mpho showed the Italian early examples of a functions schema:
        * Based upon EAC-CPF version 1 
        * Conforms to ISDF
        * Version 0.9 Salvatore Vassallo
        * Test schema for encoding functions based on International Standard for Describing Functions
            * Stated to be a test and thus unstable
        * Relationship types:
            * **Function**: link: role = activity
            * **Resource**: link: arcrole = recordcreated
            * **CPF**: link: arcrole = performing
    * Elizabeth has made a first version of a data model originating in the discussion from last time and using the terms from ISO. (see notes from 2022-02-09)
        * Our conclusion: it's good to see it visually and the discussion is continuing.
        * More work is needed especially in differentiating between function, process and activity
    * Dia has been looking into ISDF and reports back that functions are high level and real. 
        * We need to look into this more to grasp the differences.
* Action points
    * A diagram of the Glasgowian example from ISDF to deepen understanding and compare to the image we had for today (Elizabeth)
    * The deep dive continues with the need for translations of all the ISDF examples so we can understand them. Google translate will be used for a first go.
        * Spanish, French, Arabic (Dia)
        * Portuguese (Mpho)
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * Wednesday 23rd of March 2022, 4pm CET (Observe US daylight saving time change!)
