## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Question from Silke
    * Provide input to a German news article regarding the EAS standards?
        * Yes we will do this but need input regarding date to be ready, length and some more on the format. Karin to collect more info.
        * To cover:
            * This is a draft and work in progress
            * Gather input
            * What have we examined to end with our conclusion and proposal
            * Versions, standalone file with relations or a file with a hierarchy built into it, think EAD and câ€™s.
            * First this is how it can look, then schema and TL
            * Thinking about Linked Data capabilities
            * Possibility to reuse already created ontologies to give properties to elements, think relations elements in EAC-CPF
            * Users of functions don't usually use descriptive standards
* Action points
    * Karin will gather more input for creation of the news text and when that is known Karin will setup a document to write in and inform the team about it
    * Elizabeth will update the example based upon the discussion today and send out a mail saying the update is available
    * Dia will when the example is available look at how it would work with superseded and a connection to a new agent.
    * The rest, look into the example and see if there are elements that Elizabeth has put in the example that already exist in EAC-CPF so we can reuse definitions and the element.
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * Wednesday 9th of November 2022, 4pm CET
