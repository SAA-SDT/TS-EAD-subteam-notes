## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Result from last meetings actions points
    * We have a comparison available made by Joost between ISDF and the 4 examples schemas
    * Karin showed the Swedish and French early examples of a functions schema:
        * Swedish:
            * Based upon EAC beta
            * Have more elements than needed since it incorporates miniEAD and miniEAC
            * Relationship  types:
                * **EAC**: superior, subordinate, earlier, later, associative, parent, child and identity
                * **Resource**: origination, destruction, control, causa, subject and other
                * **Function**: hierarchical, temporal, associative and superior
        * French:
            * Based upon EAc-CPF version 1
            * Contains the ISDF elements but some have other names
            * Relationship  types:
                * **CPF**: controlledBy, ownedBy and performedBy
                * **Resource**: creatorOf, subjectOf and controllerOf
                * **Function**: hierarchical, hierarchical-parent, hierarchical-child, temporal, temporal-earlier, temporal-later and associative
    * Dia showed the Swiss example of a functions schema:
        * It describes one process of an agency and not the function of the agency
    * The question arises, what are being described: Functions or Processes??
        * ISO definition of terms:
            * **process**; set of interrelated or interacting activities which transforms inputs into outputs
            * **function**; group of activities aimed at achieving one or more goals of an organization
            * **activity**; task performed by an organization
            * **work process**; one or more sequences of actions required to produce an outcome that complies with governing rules
        * So is a function the same as a process when it comes to description?
            * We lean towards no.
        * A function results in records created by following a defined process
* Action points
    * Go through the examples that were handed over to Joost. There is the Google Sheet comparison which contains all elements but we need to get our own understanding and especially describe the relations.
        * Italy (Mpho)
    * Create a model for us to discuss following our findings (Elizabeth)
    * Deep dive into the ISDF examples (Dia)
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * Wednesday 9h of March 2022, 3pm CET
