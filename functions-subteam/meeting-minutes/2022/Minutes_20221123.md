## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* German news article have been handed over
* Result from earlier actions points
    * Elizabeth has made updated examples in XML, two function examples (simple and complex).
        * The simple example relies upon &lt;relations> to link to related functions (and an example of how to deal with related functions that only are in effect for a limited period of time).  
        * The complex example tries to include all the subfunctions within a single XML record.  
* Discussion
    * How to handle sequencing in the complex example
        * Relationships internally with the help of @id and @target 
    * How to deprecate a subfunction (and document that was done)
        * Deprecation with maintenance event and the attribute for referencing an maintenance event 
* Plan to move forward
    * Flash out the examples Elizabeth created with addition of attributes and elements from EAC-CPF version 2
    * Create more examples once this is done, the French ISDF examples for instance
* Action points
    * Karin to update the newly created examples with attributes and elements from EAC-CPF
    * Elizabeth to check the ontology elements and make sure they are correct after Karins additions
    * Dia to investigate and create text that can be turned into examples with lifelike descriptions of changes in the form Agency B takes over the function from agency A.
    * The rest, look into the examples and give comments!
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * Wednesday 7th of December 2022, 4pm CET
