    * Karin showed how the relations will be in the new version of EAC-CPF using the draft TL. And typing of relations  
    * What are the relations a function has? The discussion gave the following suggestions.
        * EAC-CPF “performed by”
        * EAD “Associative”?
        * Function “Parent/Child/Replaces/Follows/Precede”
    * Are we looking at a separate standard or can it be part of the ones we already maintain in TS EAS? (Also talked about in the previous meeting)
        * If incorporated it gives limitations in for example reuse
        * If separated, it gives all the flexibility needed
        * Karin remark: Look also at the arguments document
    * A look into the French schema. One of the schemes that was handed over to Joost in the early work. Main focus the relations.
        * Agents relations: controlledBy, ownedBy, performedBy
        * Resource relation: creatorOf, subjectOf, controllerOf
        * Function: hierarchical, hierarchical-parent, hierarchical-child, temporal, temporal-earlier, temporal-later, associative
    * How are relations to functions handled in a records management system?	
        * Karin: In Sweden its built into the classification schema in the ERMS
