## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Result from last meetings actions points
    * Karin showed the updated mapping from ISDF to EAC-CPF version 2
    * Dia has looked at RAD. In RAD itâ€™s possible to relate a function to rights and access restrictions, that is something to keep in mind.
    * Dia has created an outline of the use of the EAC-CPF relation element for ISDF
* Plan to move forward
    * Treat function and activity as equals 
    * Use just one relation element (the EAC-CPF one) not one for relation to function/activities and one for all other relations
    * The relation using the EAC-CPF elements is the ones that needs to be examined more
        * Test with the ISDF examples
* Action points
    * Karin will create a full XML template of the relation element from EAC-CPF. (and a Google doc)
    * Dia will do the Mexico example
    * Elizabeth will do the Glasgow example and if time permits, the French example.
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * Wednesday 25th of May 2022, 4pm CEST (Moved to Wednesday 1st of June due to the TS EAS meeting on the 25th)
    * The booking will be sent for every second week until the end of 2022
