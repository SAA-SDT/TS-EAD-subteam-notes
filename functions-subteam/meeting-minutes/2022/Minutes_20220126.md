## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Result from last meetings actions points
    * Starting question from Dia: What do we want to achieve?
        * How are ISO standards aiding us?
            * The ISO standards can aid us with terms and vocabularies and possible structure
        * How is ISDF part of this?
            * We are having the origination for our standards in the ICA standards, ISAD-G, ISAAR-CPF, ISDF so we need to start there, 
    * Findings
        * Dia checked semantic relationships in ANSI/NISO Z39.19-2005, this might be a starting point. A file with this information can be found in our working material.
        * RiC don't have all relations that might be needed. 
        * Do we need to describe the functions with more information?
        * Big part of functions is describing the relations between them. The description itself is “easier”.
            * Can all functions be described in one file of for example EAC-CPF?
            * Do the functions need to be separate entities in their own files?
* Action points
    * A deeper look into the relation types in RiC (Elizabeth)
    * Continuation with the ISO standards, relations and lists of terms (Dia)
    * Relations in EAC-CPF (Karin)
* Next meeting (Karin)
    * Wednesday 9th of February 2022, 3pm CET
