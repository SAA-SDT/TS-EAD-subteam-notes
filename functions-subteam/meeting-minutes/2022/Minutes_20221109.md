* Remaining action points
    * Elizabeth will update the example based upon the discussion today and send out a mail saying the update is available
    * Dia will when the example is available look at how it would work with superseded and a connection to a new agent.
    * The rest, look into the example and see if there are elements that Elizabeth has put in the example that already exist in EAC-CPF so we can reuse definitions and the element.
