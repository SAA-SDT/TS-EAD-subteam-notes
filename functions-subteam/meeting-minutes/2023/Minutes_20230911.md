## Agenda and notes



* Welcome! (Karin)
* Discussion
    * Looking at the examples we now have with EAD/EAC-CPF/Functions we see:
        * EAD3
            * There needs to be pointers (relations) to functions in different C-levels to be sure to relate the correct things with each other
            * When creating a relation it is needed to be able to connect with agent and its role to a function
            * The best way to point to a specific function from a series/document might be to have one function/activity per function file otherwise it needs to be possible to point to ID’s of a function/activity
        * EAD2002
            * Not suitable for relating to functions
        * The examples currently named Example...
            * Create a subfunction for grants
            * These are a high level connect the dots of the 3 standards
            * Needs renaming so they have a better name
        * A complex example
            * Reusing the Swedish complex example to create EAC-CPF records and an EAD3 where pointers will be made to the functions in the correct place
            * We need to have series and some more levels so we can point to the function at the correct level
            * We have a full set of all the suggested elements in one file currently just used for the working group, “Checked functions.xml”
        * We need to illustrate the relations between the standards
        * We need to show the use cases
        * We will need some changes in the relations like
            * Addition of the targetRelationship
    * Continue with the action points!
* Action points
    * Karin
