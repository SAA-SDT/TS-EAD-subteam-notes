## Current Status

Since our last TS-EAS meeting on 2022-02-24, the Functions group has meet biweekly and:

1. We have examined the example schemas to see how they align with ISDF and EAC-CPF. Different results and different solutions.
1. We have translated the examples from ISDF to English and Elizabeth have visulised them to aid with understanding the standard.
2. We are reading and keeping up with other standards to get input into the work
3. We are making conclusions: treat functions as activities, the relations (to other functions/activities/EAD/EAC-CPF/other resources) is the important part.
4. We are using the new version of EAC-CPF as a base for testing the elements in ISDF

## Big Questions

- Still on the table: We also need to be able to answer the question of why we do this and there we are aided by the work made by Joost and the decision in 2019 by TS EAS. 

## Forthcoming projects/initiatives

- Testing ISDF using EAC-CPF version 2 as the basis and template
