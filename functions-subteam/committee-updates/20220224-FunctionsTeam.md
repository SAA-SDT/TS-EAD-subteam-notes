## Current Status

Since our last TS-EAS meeting on 2021-10-21, the Functions group has formed and accomplished four major goals:

1. The subteam has formed and currently meets biweekly
1. Joost van Koutrik have had a hand off meeting with us
1. We are going through Joost's findings and adds some more like examples from Atom
1. We are thoroughly going through functions relations and lerning more about them by for example evaluating RiC

## Big Questions

- We are working with the big question how to treat functions, is it a schema in its own right or shoul√∂d it be included in EAC-CPF and/or EAD. Our first reply is that due to the relations it needs to be its own schema.
- We also need to be able to answer the question of why we do this and there we are aided by the work made by Joost and the decision in 2019 by TS EAS. 

## Forthcoming projects/initiatives

- Continue the just started work with examining the example schemas Joost gathered and see how they aid in compination with the release of the updated EAC-CPF
