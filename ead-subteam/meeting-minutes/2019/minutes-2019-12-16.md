## Update on rolling revision cycle
- Review of proposal from Standards Committee with regard to minor and major changes
  - Note: this is about single changes, not - necessarily - about minor and major revisions, which could comprise of several changes combined
- With the proposal from Standards currently being reviewed and possibly revised, EAD team agrees that it is too early to determine whether - and how - TS-EAS' rolling revision cycle would need to be adapted
  - As far as it is possible to say based on the current status of the proposal, there shouldn't be too much that would require adaptation
  - Next meeting of Standards - initially planned for 19 December 2019 - has now been postponed to 16 January 2020
  - The aim seems to be to have the proposal finalised in January in order to submit to SAA Council for approval
    - Reminder to all to have a look at the document and comment, where necessary
- Visualisation drafted by Noah
  - Initial approval by EAD team with the addition of community testing during May/June and changing the header to be more generally about EAS, not specifically about EAD3
  - Noah to finalise draft and to send to all TS-EAS members for feedback

## EAS Section Survey
- See https://pennstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_esXwaNgSJRKVYFL
- Deadline for feedback on 31 January 2020
- Detailed discussion postponed until next meeting

## EAD3 #517
- https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/517
- Comments received so far:
  - Have emphasised concerns with regard to data exchange and interoperability (“...should not replace the core requirements for the c/did...”)
  - Have brought forward a more concrete encoding example (using MARC21 directly within &lt;c>), but have not brought forward any additional use cases from other community members
  - Have suggested an extension of &lt;odd> to accommodate other namespace metadata
    - With the addition (from Mark) to maybe remove &lt;objectxmlwrap> and open some elements (&lt;relation>, &lt;source>, &lt;odd>) to encorporate other namespace elements directly
- Suggestion to contact SNAC and Kalliope representatives directly to ask for examples as they might make quite extensive use of &lt;objectxmlwrap> in their contexts
- Alex and Mark to - possibly - add examples from their institutions to further conversation

## Any other business
- Next meeting on Tuesday, 28 January 2020, will be a joint meeting of EAC-CPF, EAD and Schema teams on the topic of Shared Schema / EAD3 reconciliation
- All to review proposed decision tree ahead of the meeting (as shared via email already)
- All to look out for more detailed proposals for selected elements with regard to potential changes for reconciliation
  - We aim to share these by 17 January
