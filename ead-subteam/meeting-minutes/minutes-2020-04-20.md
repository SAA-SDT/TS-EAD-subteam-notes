## 3. Issues from EAD3 reconciliation topic at EAC-CPF meeting in Berlin
### 3.1. General information
- See minutes and additional meeting documentation on GitHub: https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/tree/master/eaccpf-subteam/meeting-minutes/2020/f2f-meetings/Berlin

### 3.2. Issues for decision by and/or input from EAD team (today’s meeting)
- Issue #520
  - https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/520
  - DECISION to rename the element `<script>` to `<writingsystem>` in both EAS
    - General question of spelling is pending design principles discussion with TS-EAS as a whole (potentially at the May meeting)
  - Follow-up DECISIONS (no changes for EAD):
    - Both EAS will use the element `<language>` for the natural language form of the language used either in the EAS instance itself or by the entity described (record/record set or person/corporate body/family);
    - Both EAS will use the attribute `@lang` for the ISO code of the language used  for the content of a specific element;
      - The design principle of avoiding abbreviations would in this case be overruled by the design principle of not having an element (`<language>`) and an attribute (`@language`) of the same name;
    - Both EAS will use the attribute `@langcode` for the ISO code of the language used either in the EAS instance itself or by the entity described (record/record set or person/corporate body/family);
    - Both EAS will use the attribute `@script` for the ISO code of the script/writing system/alphabet used for the content of a specific element;
    - Both EAS will use the attribute `@scriptcode` for the ISO code of the script/writing system/alphabet used either in the EAS instance itself or by the entity described (record/record set or person/corporate body/family).
  - To be confirmed by EAC-CPF Team during their next meeting (24 April)  
- Date elements 
  - Formal adoption of decisions taken by EAC-CPF Team during their meeting in Berlin (9-12 March)
    - DECISION to add `@status` as a new attribute for `<date>`, `<fromdate>`, `<todate>`
    - DECISION to implement schema change for `<daterange>` (either `<fromdate>` or `<todate>` have to be present as sub-elements of `<daterange>`, but they could be empty)
    - DECISION to add `@calendar` and `@era` for `<fromdate>` and `<todate>` -> confirmed
  - `<date>` vs. `<datesingle>`
    - When EAD3 adopted the model for structured date information from EAC-CPF, using the three parallel elements `<date>`, `<daterange>` and `<dateset>`, it was faced with the challenge that `<date>` was used on mixed content contexts as well. In order to avoid using the same element in two rather different ways within EAD3, the single date element within the "dates" group was renamed to `<datesingle>`for EAD.
    - In the context of reconciliation between both EAS and with regard to potentially establishing a shared schema core for all (current and future) EAS, this however poses the challenge that the same element `<date>` is now used differently in EAC-CPF than it is in EAD3.
    - Possible approaches to solve this:
      - Shifting the name distinction to EAC, i.e. using <datesingle> together with <daterange> and <dateset> in both EAS and using <date> only in EAD3;
      - Eliminating <date> as a mixed content option in EAD, i.e. not enabling anymore the encoding of any kind of dates as part of longer descriptive texts and fully adopting the EAC model by using <date> together with <daterange> and <dateset>;
      - Considering the renaming both elements in EAD3 to allow for a shared use of `<date>`, to enable the additional use of a mixed content element e.g. called `<contextualdate>` or `<genericdate>` or `<mixeddate>` or `<textualdate>`, and to make a clearer distinction between both.
    - DECISION to deprecate/remove the current `<date>` element as mixed content element and to rename the current `<datesingle>` to `<date>` to be used in the same way as in EAC-CPF
