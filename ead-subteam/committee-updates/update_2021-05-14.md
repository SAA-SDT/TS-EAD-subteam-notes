## 3. Accomplishments, March 2021 to mid-May 2021

Listed here are the EAD team's principal accomplishments from the past two-and-a-half months:
- Major revision of EAD
  - Between end of January and early April 2021, we ran a short survey to get a better understanding of the lay of the land, especially the split between using EAD 2002 and EAD3 within the community as well as getting our hands on example files to illustrate certain use cases, e.g. the use of `@localtype` and `<localcontrol>` in EAD3.
    - The survey included three questions: which version of EAD an institution uses, if there was any specific feedback on EAD and a potential new version, and if the respondent was fine with possibly being contacted for further information. 
    - We had 39 responses in total, with 21 out of these providing more specific feedback and 8 providing contact details.
    - Out of the 39 responses, nearly 70% continue using EAD 2002; more than 56% solely use EAD 2002, while another 13% use EAD 2002 in combination with EAD3.
    - About 25% use EAD3; half of these solely use EAD3, half of these use EAD3 in combination with EAD 2002.
    - The survey did not cater for details to be added in case both versions were used in parallel, which could be an interesting aspect to follow up upon.
    - The feedback provided on EAD (both versions) and a potential new version covered the following aspects:
      - Data modelling and schema design, along with EAD’s relationship to other standards
      - Data granularity, with regard to which the community (still) seems to be split
      - Requirements on resources and staffing to actually implement a new version of a(ny) standard, going along with the topic of tools and other resources to help in implementation and application as well as the aspect of collaborating with consortia and aggregators to increase the uptake of a (new version of a) standard
      - Specific aspects of archival description, e.g. digital objects (digitised and born-digital), citations and sources, multilinguality
    - All details can be found in the shared TS-EAS Google folder (EAD > MajorRevision_2021-2024 > BackgroundReading_SurveyResults)
  - A funding request has been submitted to SAA in order to support travel expenses for a face-to-face meeting, which we hope to be able to hold in spring 2022 as our actual kick-off to the revision.
    - This will be on the agenda of SAA's general budget meeting this month.
  - EAD team has started reviewing the draft of EAC-CPF 2.0 with regard to topics that will require alignment changes in EAD.
    - We have agreed to remove deprecated elements and attributes according to what was announced when publishing EAD3. The aim for the new version of EAD will be to not have a deprecated and an undeprecated version again. 
    - We have discussed and agreed to adopt EAC-CPF 2.0's approach to some selected topics, such as the general attributes `@audience` and `@id`, the attribute `@base`, the attribute `@value`, the attribute `@unit`, the attribute `@target`, and the introduction of attributes from any namespace.
      - For `@base` we will ask the community for use cases as part of the call for comments. 
      - `@value` will essentially be removed from EAD as it is currently only used with sub-elements of `<control>` which will be turned into attributes themselves in the new version.
    - We have discussed the topic of assertion description and have agreed the following changes in accordance to what is proposed in EAC-CPF 2.0:
      - Add `<descriptiveNote>` to `<sources>`
      - Remove `<sourceentry>` from `<source>` and use `<reference>` (renamed `<ref>`) instead
      - Add `<citedRange>` to `<source>
      - Adapt the sequence of sub-elements in `<source>`
      - Remove `@transliteration` and to use `<conventionDeclaration>` to specify any transliteration rules along with `@conventionDeclarationReference` to point to such rules from elements of the `<archDesc>` section
      - Add the optional attributes `@conventionDeclarationReference`, `@maintenanceEventReference`, and `@sourceReference` to all non-empty elements of EAD that are used outside of the `<control>` section including `<archDesc>`, but excluding `<emph>` and `<foreign>``
    - We have discussed the topic of `<biogHist>`, though have not made any formal decision yet as most differences between EAD3 1.1.1 and the draft for EAC-CPF 2.0 are not specific to this element, but rather refer to the more general and conceptual difference between EAC-CPF and EAD. 
    - We have discussed the topic of language elements and attributes and have agreed the following changes in accordance to what is proposed in EAC-CPF 2.0:
      - Rename `@lang` to `@languageOfElement`, `@script` to `@scriptOfElement`, `@langcode` to `@languageCode`, and `@scriptcode` to `@scriptCode`
      - Rename `<script>` to `<writingSystem>`(following our previous decision on EAD3 #520)
      - Remove sub-elements `<language>` and (now) `<writingSystem>` from `<languageDeclaration>`
      - Add `@languageCode` and `@scriptCode` directly to `<languageDeclaration>`
    - We have started discussing the topic of linking attributes and have already agreed to the following changes in accordance to what is proposed in EAC-CPF 2.0:
      - Remove `@actuate`, `@arcrole`, and `@show` from the group of general linking attributes and to keep only `@href`, `@linkRole`, and `@linkTitle`
      - Rename `@source` to `@vocabularySource` and add the sibling attribute `@vocabularySourceURI`
      - Replace `@identifier` with `@valueURI` 
        - The definition of `@valueURI` as "anyURI" - in theory - still allows for whitespaces or other non-URI characters to be used (all but “ % &), but we will check with the community during the call for comments if there are use cases where this change might cause troubles
        - In the specific use case of `@identifier` with `<unitid>`, we have agreed that this might rather be a use case for `@target`
      - Replace `@rules` with `@conventionDeclarationReference` and point to an according `<conventionDeclaration>` element
- Minor revision of the EAD3 Tag Library (with Schema team)
  - The request for a minor revision has been submitted to the Standards Committee and was on the agenda for their meeting on 13 May.
    - No specific questions, voting process ongoing.
- Minor revision of the EAD 2002 Schemas (with Schema team)
  -  The request for a minor revision has been drafted and the schemas have been updated. 
  -  The changes include:
    - Updating the RNG schema to UTF-8 encoding   
    - Removing the value lists for country, langguage, repository, and script codes and changing the data type of the relevant attributes (`countrycode`, `@langcode`, `@mainagencycode`, `repositorycode`, and `@scriptcode` to NMTOKEN
  - This is pending final tests, but is intended to be submitted to the Standards Committee for their June meeting.
- Collaboration with Outreach team on set of webinars around EAD
  - We will be holding a webinar/panel session focused on EAD case studies in the first week of June.
  - We will have two sessions with three speakers each who will present their EAD use case in short presentations of 10 minutes max. allowing for enough time for a Q&A with the panel and the audience afterwards.
    - We have three speakers (all US-based) from single institutions (1 using EAD3, 2 using EAD 2002), two speakers from national archives aggregators (both European, 1 using EAD3, 1 using EAD 2002), and one speaker from a software/archival collection management provider (US-based, enabling EAD3)
    - We have tried to get speakers from Asia and/or Oceania involved, but without success
  - Sessions will be on 2 (6am GMT) and 4 June (3pm GMT)
  - Announcement text with registration information has been sent out via the EAD mailing list on Thursday 13 May - **please distribute generously via your networks**
 
## 4. Forthcoming projects, initiatives, and priorities

Tasks on the agenda of EAD team for the upcoming months are:
- Major revision of EAD
  - In the upcoming team meetings in May and June, we will furthermore discuss the following topics in order to be in a position to provide feedback to the EAC-CPF team as part of the call for comments on EAC-CPF 2.0 by the end of June:
    - Finalising the topic of linking attributes
    - `<control>`
    - `<relations>`
    - Controlled access elements
    - `@localType` and `@localTypeDeclarationReference`
    - Encoding of places 
    - Encoding of dates
    - Formatting and mixed content elements (as far as they are concerned in the alignment between the two EAS) 
  - Based on this, we will prepare an initial - and internal - draft for a future EAD 4.0 including an update to the (deprecated) schema as well as to the tag library to reflect the changes resulting from the alignment between EAC-CPF and EAD
  - The intent is to then publish a call for comments in September/October with a running time until the end of this year
- Minor revisions of EAD3 Tag Library and EAD 2002 schema
  - Next steps will be pending the Standards Committee's decisions
- Collaboration with the Outreach team
  - Exploring the options for a digital "brown bag lunch" during the Annual Meeting
  - Holding a webinar focused on introducing the EAD revision a little more; after the call for comments was released; ~October
