## 3. Current status (as of 2018-07-24)

Listed here are the EAD team's principal accomplishments from the previous year:

1. Coordinated the release of EAD3 v1.1.0. The new version contains [7 changes](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/blob/master/RELEASE.md#new-in-ead3-110) to the schema. The most significant change is the introduction of a new rightsdeclaration element in the control section to communicate the rights status of the description (finding aid) itself.  Other work involved in issuing the EAD3 v1.1.0 release included:
   - Working with the Schema Team, the EAD team finalized feature requests and bug fixes to be included in EAD3 1.1.0 and tested versions of the schema in preparation for the release.
   - Advertised and managed a comment period (January-February 2018) to gather feedback on the pending release.
   - Worked with the Documentation Subteam to update the EAD3 Tag Library and introduced [a new method for communicating incremental changes in the the Tag Libraries](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/blob/master/UPDATING.md)
   - Coordinated with Library of Congress to add [updated EAD3 schemas and Tag Libraries to the official EAD website](https://www.loc.gov/ead/)
   - Advertised new EAD3 v1.1.0 release on all relevant listservs (EAD list, SAA lists, APEnet list, Twitter, etc.)

2. Discussed and commented on [additional feature requests](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues) for EAD3 (Github issues)
   
3. Revised and advertised an [EAD3 Implementation Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/EAD3) (SurveyMonkey) to assess the current rate of implementation and identify potential barriers to EAD3 implementation. Survey is open until September 15, 2018.

4. Worked with ArchivesSpace team and community developers to build and release an [EAD3 v1.0 exporter for ArchivesSpace v2.2.0](http://archivesspace.org/archives/2476) (October 2017).

## 4. Initiatives underway

- Codifying and documenting the revision process, release cycle, and dependencies for making incremental revisions to EAD3 (schemas, Tag Libraries, etc.). Establishing and documenting this process will help standardize and streamline future incremental releases. Some [preliminary notes on the revision process sequence](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/TS-EAS-subteam-notes/blob/master/ead-subteam/meeting-minutes/minutes-2018-03-26.md).
- Collecting and analyzing responses from the EAD3 Implementation Survey

## 5. Forthcoming projects/initiatives desired, priorities

- Develop, publish, and advertise EAD3 Validation FAQ / Guidelines (e.g. how to validate using schematron).
- Publish results of EAD3 Implementation survey, noting any trends since survey was last distributed.
- Work with Schema Team to brainstorm ways to simplify the maintenance of schemas and tag libraries.
- Explore other ways to encourage adoption of EAD3 (e.g. integrating support into Archival Management Systems).
- Work with SAA's EAS Section to update EAD-related information on SAA pages (Example: https://www2.archivists.org/groups/encoded-archival-standards-section/frequently-asked-questions-about-ead-and-ead3)
