## 3. Accomplishments, August 2019 to July 2020

Listed here are the EAD team's principal accomplishments from the previous year:

- Rolling revision cycle
  - Approval by the TS-EAS members in late 2019. It has been extended to now represent a workflow for all EAS in future while they are not undergoing a major revision. The rolling revision cycle along with a visualisation has been made available on the main GitHub page of EAD3: https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3. 
  - Pending the ongoing conversations within and with Standards Committee concerning minor and major changes to the EAS, the rolling revision cycle might require smaller editions in the upcoming months. 
- Release of the EAD3 1.1.1 patch release in December 2019.
  - The main issues covered by this patch release were a bug fix with regard to `<c12>` in the XSD versions of the schema and the (re-)addition of `<foreign>` as an optional sub-element of `<ref>`
  - All details can be found here: https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/releases/tag/v1.1.1
- Continued regular review of GitHub issues 
  - Various issues registered in the EAD3 repository are currently led by the Schema team as they relate to aspects of using Schematron.
    - Aim: develop, publish, and advertise EAD3 Validation FAQ / Guidelines (e.g. how to validate using schematron).
  - Gathered feedback from the community on issue #517(https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/517) - potentially extended use of `<objectxmlwrap>`.
    - 
    

- Question of a minor release in 2020
- Decide on potential EAD3 1.2 release for 2020 (will depend on https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/517 mainly, but potentially also on some aspects coming out of EAD3 reconciliation conversations with EAC team as mentioned below)
  - After finalising the conversation on issue #517 (https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/517), EAD team has decided not to  endorse the suggested change, but to emphasise the use of the existing solution with `<relations>`. Apart from the concerns with regard to interoperability, this also speaks to the circumstance that EAD is an archival description standard, not a “wrapping” standard such as e.g. METS.
  - Furthermore, EAD team has decided not to aim at another release (EAD3 1.2) during 2020 and to tackle the remaining issues (#467, #498, #501, #503, #508), which are mainly around the use of Schematron and similar aspects, in the context of general harmonisation tasks between EAD3 and EAC-CPF.
- EAD3 reconciliation as part of EAC-CPF revision
- On 28 January 2020, EAD team held a joint meeting with the EAC and Schema teams to discuss various aspects that have come up in the context of EAD3 reconciliation during the major EAC-CPF revision. While this meeting mainly concentrated on aspects around attributes, which either exist in one, but not in the other standard or exist in both, but are not used consistently, the conversation will be continued during the EAC-CPF meeting in Berlin (9-12 March), where there will be one day dedicated to EAD3 reconciliation topics. 
  - EAC-CPF team dedicated one day of the meeting in Berlin (9 to 12 March) to reconciliation topics with EAD3, which was led by the EAD team lead.
  - Following conversations in Berlin as well as in virtual meetings of both teams afterwards, EAD team will be looking into registering some initial issues on GitHub for a future major revision of EAD. Some initial decisions include:
    - Renaming `<script>` to `<writingsystem>` following the note about potential security risks in issue #520 (https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/520); some related questions (see issue #520 again for details) are currently pending final decision between EAD and EAC-CPF teams.
    - Formally adopting the changes to date elements suggested as part of the EAC-CPF revision also for EAD3.
    - Deprecating/removing the current `<date>` element as mixed content element in EAD3 and renaming the current `<datesingle>` to `<date>` to be used in the same way as in EAC-CPF.
  - There also is another joint meeting planned between both teams in early July.

## 4. Forthcoming projects, initiatives, and priorities

- Explore other ways to encourage adoption of EAD3 (e.g. integrating support into Archival Management Systems, reaching out to aggregators/consortia).
- Finalise EAD3 reconciliation as part of EAC-CPF revision
- Work with Outreach team and SAA's EAS Section to update EAD-related information on SAA pages (Example: https://www2.archivists.org/groups/encoded-archival-standards-section/frequently-asked-questions-about-ead-and-ead3).
- Work on additional examples and use cases for EAD3 implementation; this is following up on one of the suggestions from the EAD3 Implementation Report last year.
- Looking into webinar topics on EAD together with the Outreach team.
- Taking care of some smaller corrections of the EAD3 Tag Library (#49, #50, #53, #54, #55, #56).
