# SAA TS-EAS EAD Team Report July 2017

## 1. Purpose/scope of team responsibilities (as you and your team have envisioned it)

The purpose of the EAD Team is to maintain and support the usage of Encoded Archival Description. This includes fixing bugs in EAD3, considering and implementing requests from the community, maintaining documentation, and communicating with the EAD user community.

## 2. Team membership 2016-2017
- Wim van Dongen
- Noah Huffman
- Silke Jagodzinski
- Mike Rush, team leader
- Bill Stockting
- Kathy Wisser

## 3. Current status, update from December meeting

As previously reported, the EAD Team set four main goals for the year:

1. Propose suggested EAD3 tag usage for metadata rights statements
2. Plan out schema changes
3. Publish EAD3 Validation Guidelines
4. Carry out an implementation survey

The EAD Team finished its work on goals 1 and 2. In response to the need for guideance on how to encode metadata rights statements in EAD3, we resolved to add a new element to the schema, <rightsdeclaration>, which would be an optional child of <control>. See 
[Issue 506](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/506) in the EAD3 repository issue tracker on GitHub for the full proposal.

Toward goal 2 the EAD Team reviewed and made recommendations regarding three additional EAD3 feature requests (see 
[Issue 485](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/485), 
[Issue 505](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/505), and 
[Issue 507](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/507)) and two bug reports (
[Issue 499](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/499) and 
[Issue 503](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/503)). All EAD Team recommendations regarding feature requests and bug fixes were accepted without comment by TS-EAS.

Goal 4 has also been accomplished. On 21 June, on behalf of TS-EAS and the EAD Team, Wim van Dongen circulated a poll to the EAD Community asking for feedback regarding the status of their implementation of EAD3. The poll is available at 
[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/EAD3](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/EAD3).

Mike Rush has begun work on goal 3, and hopes to have a draft of EAD3 Validation Guidelines to share before the 2017 SAA Annual Meeting in Portland.

## 4. Initiatives underway

As mentioned above, a draft of EAD3 Validation Guidelines is under development. 

Also pending is a public comment period on the 1.1 release of EAD3, which will include the new features and bug fixes mentioned above. The comment period can beginn as soon as the TS-EAS Schema Team has issued an EAD3 1.1 release candidate free of known bugs.

## 5. Forthcoming projects/initiatives desired, priorities

The primary forthcoming project for the EAD Team will be the release of EAD3 1.1 following what will hopefully be a successful comment period to evaluate the forthcoming release candidate. The release of EAD3 1.1 will continue to be managed in GitHub, and will require updates to the EAD Tag Library and the official EAD site at the Library of Congress.
