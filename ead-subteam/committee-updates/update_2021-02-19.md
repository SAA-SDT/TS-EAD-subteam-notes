## 3. Accomplishments, August 2020 to mid-February 2021

Listed here are the EAD team's principal accomplishments from the past six months:
- Major revision of EAD
  - In October 2020, we submitted a proposal for major revision of EAD to the Standards Committee, following SAA's recommended timeframe of revising an existing standard every 5 years.
  - The revision process was approved in December 2020 and first steps have been announced to the community in January 2021.
    - For the time being, we are mainly interested in the lay of the land, especially the split between using EAD 2002 and EAD3 within the community as well as getting our hands on example files to illustrate certain use cases, e.g. the use of `@localtype` and `<localcontrol>` in EAD3.
    - A [short survey](https://forms.gle/SrfwQDQVhWayJ8hP6) has been set up for this purpose. Please make sure to **provide your feedback**, if you haven't already.
  - At the moment, we are preparing the submission of a funding request to SAA in order to support travel expenses for a face-to-face meeting, which we hope to be able to hold in spring 2022 as our actual kick-off to the revision.
    - In this context, we are also looking for **potential host institutions and/or sponsors**.
      - We would be looking at a meeting room for 10-15 people max, with decent Internet/WiFi connection, for 3 days (maybe stretched over 4 days, i.e. starting after lunch the 1st day and ending with lunch the last day), and any additional support your institution might be able to provide e.g. with regard to food and drinks.
- Minor revision of the EAD3 Tag Library
  - With no community requests on changes or corrections to the schema, we are currently preparing a minor revision of the EAD3 Tag Library to be released in the upcoming months. This will include:
    - Correction of typos [#50](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/50) and [#69](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/69)
    -  Enhancement of existing and addition of missing labels [#49](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/49) and [#55](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/55)
    - Addition of missing information [#56](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/56)
    - Addition of new sections in the Tag Library to provide data type information where applicable [#62](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/62)
    - Enhancement and addition of encoding examples [#63](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/63) 
      - We are still looking for real life examples for some of the attributes listed in this issue. Please have a look at **examples from your institutions** and make sure to comment accordingly on GitHub.
    - Corrections in cases where the Tag Library description did not reflect the schema definition correctly [#53](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/53) and [#54](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/54) 
    - Improvements with regard to the transformations of the TEI XML into HTML and PDF for publication as well as improvements for formatting [#57](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/57), [#58](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/58), [#59](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/59), [#60](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/60), [#64](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/64), and [#65](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/65) 
    - Assigning an electronic ISBN [#68](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/68)  
- Collaboration with Outreach Team on set of webinars around EAD
  - We are currently looking at three types of webinars around EAD throughout the course of this year:
    - Webinar/panel session focused on EAD3 case studies - either completed implementation or underway; together with the EAS Section's Steering Committee; ~May
    - Potentially picking up the former "brown bag lunches" in a digital format to have room for some more informal conversations with the community; maybe in the context of the Annual Meeting; August
      - This might also be something that we could use during the revision process to "test" some of our ideas.
    - Webinar focused on introducing the EAD revision a little more; after the call for comments was released; ~October 
 
## 4. Forthcoming projects, initiatives, and priorities

Tasks on the agenda of EAD team for the upcoming months are:
- Major revision of EAD
  - Next steps in the revision process for 2021 will be:
    - Review the draft for EAC-CPF 2.0 and its impact on EAD (March to May) in order to provide feedback during the call for comments period for EAC-CPF
    - Prepare an initial draft for a future EAD 4.0 including an update to the deprecated schema as well as to the tag library to reflect the changes resulting from the alignment between EAC-CPF and EAD (June to August)
    - Publish the above mentioned initial draft alongside a call for comments (September/October)
    - Continuous review of comments and feedback received as well as inclusion into GitHub to prepare official review period in 2022 (October to December)
-  Collaboration with the Outreach Team 
  - Detailing the webinar/panel session on EAD3 case studies
  - Exploring the options for a digital "brown bag lunch" during the Annual Meeting
