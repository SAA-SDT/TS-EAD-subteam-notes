## 3. Accomplishments, August 2020 to July 2021
Listed here are the EAD team's principal accomplishments from the previous year:

### 3.1 Major revision of EAD
- In October 2020, we submitted a proposal for major revision of EAD to the Standards Committee, following SAA's recommended timeframe of revising an existing standard every 5 years.
- The revision process was approved in December 2020 and first steps have been announced to the community in January 2021.
  - During the first half of 2021, we have mainly concentrated on activities that help us understand the lay of the land, especially the split between using EAD 2002 and EAD3 within the community and getting our hands on example files to illustrate certain use cases.
  - Activities included a short survey (January to March) and two webinars (June).
    - The survey included three questions: which version of EAD an institution uses, if there was any specific feedback on EAD and a potential new version, and if the respondent was fine with possibly being contacted for further information. 
      - We had 39 responses in total, with 21 out of these providing more specific feedback and 8 providing contact details.
      - Out of the 39 responses, nearly 70% continue using EAD 2002; more than 56% solely use EAD 2002, while another 13% use EAD 2002 in combination with EAD3.
      - About 25% use EAD3; half of these solely use EAD3, half of these use EAD3 in combination with EAD 2002.
      - The survey did not cater for details to be added in case both versions were used in parallel, which could be an interesting aspect to follow up upon.
      - The feedback provided on EAD (both versions) and a potential new version covered the following aspects:
        - Data modelling and schema design, along with EAD’s relationship to other standards
        - Data granularity, with regard to which the community (still) seems to be split
        - Requirements on resources and staffing to actually implement a new version of a(ny) standard, going along with the topic of tools and other resources to help in implementation and application as well as the aspect of collaborating with consortia and aggregators to increase the uptake of a (new version of a) standard
        - Specific aspects of archival description, e.g. digital objects (digitised and born-digital), citations and sources, multilinguality
      - All details can be found in the shared TS-EAS Google folder (EAD > MajorRevision_2021-2024 > BackgroundReading_SurveyResults)
    -  Details on the webinars can be found further down below in our collaboration with the Outreach team
- We submitted a funding request to SAA in order to support travel expenses for a face-to-face meeting, which we hope to be able to hold in spring 2022 as our actual kick-off to the revision.
  - Unfortunately, this request has been denied (along with all similar requests from committees and sections due to general budget restrictions and question marks around international travels with regard to COVID-19 restrictions).
  - EAD team will have to decide how to move forward with this.
- We started reviewing the draft of EAC-CPF 2.0 with regard to topics that will require alignment changes in EAD.
  - We have agreed to remove deprecated elements and attributes according to what was announced when publishing EAD3. The aim for the new version of EAD will be to not have a deprecated and an undeprecated version again. 
  - We have discussed and agreed to adopt EAC-CPF 2.0's approach to some selected topics, such as the general attributes `@audience` and `@id`, the attribute `@base`, the attribute `@value`, the attribute `@unit`, the attribute `@target`, and the introduction of attributes from any namespace.
    - For `@base` we will ask the community for use cases as part of the call for comments. 
    - `@value` will essentially be removed from EAD as it is currently only used with sub-elements of `<control>` which will be turned into attributes themselves in the new version.
  - We have discussed the topic of assertion description and have agreed the following changes in accordance to what is proposed in EAC-CPF 2.0:
    - Add `<descriptiveNote>` to `<sources>`
    - Remove `<sourceentry>` from `<source>` and use `<reference>` (renamed `<ref>`) instead
    - Add `<citedRange>` to `<source>`
    - Adapt the sequence of sub-elements in `<source>`
    - Remove `@transliteration` and to use `<conventionDeclaration>` to specify any transliteration rules along with `@conventionDeclarationReference` to point to such rules from elements of the `<archDesc>` section
    - Add the optional attributes `@conventionDeclarationReference`, `@maintenanceEventReference`, and `@sourceReference` to all non-empty elements of EAD that are used outside of the `<control>` section including `<archDesc>`, but excluding `<emph>` and `<foreign>`
  - We have discussed the topic of `<biogHist>`, though have not made any formal decision yet as most differences between EAD3 1.1.1 and the draft for EAC-CPF 2.0 are not specific to this element, but rather refer to the more general and conceptual difference between EAC-CPF and EAD. 
  - We have discussed the topic of language elements and attributes and have agreed the following changes in accordance to what is proposed in EAC-CPF 2.0:
    - Rename `@lang` to `@languageOfElement`, `@script` to `@scriptOfElement`, `@langcode` to `@languageCode`, and `@scriptcode` to `@scriptCode`
    - Rename `<script>` to `<writingSystem>`(following our previous decision on EAD3 #520)
    - Remove sub-elements `<language>` and (now) `<writingSystem>` from `<languageDeclaration>`
    - Add `@languageCode` and `@scriptCode` directly to `<languageDeclaration>`
  - We have discussed the topic of linking attributes and have agreed to the following changes in accordance to what is proposed in EAC-CPF 2.0:
    - Remove `@actuate`, `@arcrole`, and `@show` from the group of general linking attributes and to keep only `@href`, `@linkRole`, and `@linkTitle`
    - Rename `@source` to `@vocabularySource` and add the sibling attribute `@vocabularySourceURI`
    - Replace `@identifier` with `@valueURI` 
      - The definition of `@valueURI` as "anyURI" - in theory - still allows for whitespaces or other non-URI characters to be used (all but “ % &), but we will check with the community during the call for comments if there are use cases where this change might cause troubles
      - In the specific use case of `@identifier` with `<unitid>`, we have agreed that this might rather be a use case for `@target`
    - Replace `@rules` with `@conventionDeclarationReference` and point to an according `<conventionDeclaration>` element 
    - Keep `@relator` for the time being and evaluate its use during phase 2
      - Need examples from the community
      - Need to check if this is mainly used with [MARC relators](https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators.html) or also in other contexts
      - Probably needs to be looked at in the more general context of relations in EAD
    - Add `vocabularySource`, `@vocabularySourceURI`, and `@valueURI` to elements that currently use `@identifier`, `@source`, and `@rules` as well as to all elements that are shared between the two EAS and where these attributes have been made available in the draft for EAC-CPF 2.0
    - Follow EAC-CPF 2.0 in NOT adding these three attributes to `<part>` and `<term>`
      - For EAD, this essentially means removing this option from `<part>` and `<term>` as well as considering an appropriate transformation
    - Suggest to EAC team to remove the attribute `@lastDateTimeVerified` completely (due to lack of use cases actively implementing this) and to point to option of including attributes from any namespace (or localControl, localType) if users of the EAS would really want to include this information
  - We have discussed the element `<control>`
  - We have discussed the options for encoding dates
  - We have discussed aspects of formatting elements and started discussing the mixed content approach of EAD
    - This has currently focussed on elements that are shared between the two EAS, but will need to be extended and reviewed further in phase 2 with regard to additional, EAD-specific elements

### 3.2 Minor revision of the EAD3 Tag Library
- With no community requests on changes or corrections to the schema during 2020, we concentrated on a minor revision of the EAD3 Tag Library. This was approved by the Standards Committee in May and will be released by the end of this month. The revision will include:
  - Correction of typos [#50](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/50) and [#69](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/69)
  -  Enhancement of existing and addition of missing labels [#49](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/49) and [#55](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/55)
  - Addition of missing information [#56](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/56)
  - Addition of new sections in the Tag Library to provide data type information where applicable [#62](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/62)
  - Enhancement and addition of encoding examples [#63](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/63) 
  - Corrections in cases where the Tag Library description did not reflect the schema definition correctly [#53](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/53) and [#54](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/54) 
  - Improvements with regard to the transformations of the TEI XML into HTML and PDF for publication as well as improvements for formatting [#57](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/57), [#58](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/58), [#59](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/59), [#60](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/60), [#64](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/64), and [#65](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/65) 
  - Assigning an electronic ISBN [#68](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/issues/68)  

### 3.3 Minor revision of the EAD 2002 Schema
- We also have prepared a (final) minor revision to the EAD 2002 Schema, which was approved by the Standards Committee in June and will be released along with the minor revision of the EAD3 Tag Library. The revision will include:
  - Updating the RNG schema to UTF-8 encoding   
  - Removing the value lists for country, language, repository, and script codes and changing the data type of the relevant attributes (`countrycode`, `@langcode`, `@mainagencycode`, `repositorycode`, and `@scriptcode`) to NMTOKEN

### 3.4 Collaboration with Outreach Team on set of webinars around EAD
  - We are currently looking at three types of webinars around EAD throughout the course of this year:
    - Webinar/panel session focused on EAD3 case studies - either completed implementation or underway; together with the EAS Section's Steering Committee; ~May
    - Potentially picking up the former "brown bag lunches" in a digital format to have room for some more informal conversations with the community; maybe in the context of the Annual Meeting; August
      - This might also be something that we could use during the revision process to "test" some of our ideas.
    - Webinar focused on introducing the EAD revision a little more; after the call for comments was released; ~October 

## 4. Forthcoming projects, initiatives, and priorities
- Major revision of EAD
  - Next steps in the revision process will be:
    - Finalising the review of the draft for EAC-CPF 2.0 and its impact on EAD
      - Controlled access elements
      - `<relations>`
      - `@localType` and `@localTypeDeclarationReference`
      - Encoding of places (will be done via email)
    - Provide feedback to the EAC-CPF team (where applicable)
    - Prepare an initial - and internal - draft for a future EAD 4.0 including an update to the deprecated schema as well as to the tag library to reflect the changes resulting from the alignment between EAC-CPF and EAD
    - Publish a call for comments in September/October with a running time until the end of this year
    - Continuous review of comments and feedback received as well as inclusion into GitHub to prepare official review period in 2022
