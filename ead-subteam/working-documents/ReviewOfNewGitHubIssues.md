# Workflow for engaging with new submissions to EAD3 repository on GitHub
This would be in combination with the annual calendar for minor revisions.

## Picking up on new submissions
- Team lead to keep track of new submissions in between the (monthly) meetings of the EAD team
  - Make sure email notifications are set for EAD3 repository as well as Tag Libraries repository
- Team lead to include brief comment of acknowledgement
  - Potentially indicate the date of the next meeting as an initial option for the EAD team to discuss
  - Check if submission has been made on behalf of someone else
    - If yes, send information (link to GitHub) to according email address 
  - (Added on 20 December 2019 based on the draft for major/minor changes as part of the Standards Protocol for Revisions) Ensure that submissions includes at least:
    - Name of the submitting person and/or sponsoring group;
    - Identification of the component of the standard to be changed;
    - Brief description of the proposed change, and justification

## Inclusion in the agenda for the next team meeting
- Brief review and categorisation as either:
  - Bug (with the potential assignment to other teams to correct these bugs as part of a patch release - schema and/or tag library)
  - Potential change/new feature as part of minor revision
  - Potential change/new feature as part of major revision
- Decide if further community input is necessary
  - If yes, prepare summary to be sent to EAD Listserv
  - If no, decide if further research/details are required and assign to one team member to prepare according analysis/input for (one of) the next meeting(s)

## After initial review
- Team lead to take note of team conversation (and potentially indicate next steps) in GitHub
  - (Added on 20 December 2019 based on the draft for major/minor changes as part of the Standards Protocol for Revisions) This includes according notes, where applicable, with regard to:
    - Expected effect/impact on individuals, institutions, and supporting systems;
    - Known related standards affected by the proposed change
- If decision was taken to ask for further community feedback, send according email to EAD Listserv
  - (Added on 20 December 2019 based on the draft for major/minor changes as part of the Standards Protocol for Revisions) If a submission has been categorised as potential major change, community feedback will always be the next step
  - (Added on 20 December 2019 based on the draft for major/minor changes as part of the Standards Protocol for Revisions) Inform Standards Committee co-chairs about the submission and its current status
- If decision was taken to investigate further within the EAD team, have follow-up discussion in the next team meeting based on analysis by team member to whom the research was assigned

## Inclusion in annual calendar for minor revisions
- Finalise review in the context of preparing the annual minor revision
  - During January each year
  - Based on further community input (if it was requested and provided)
  - Based on further research done by one member of the EAD team and continued team discussion
- Include in next steps indicated in the annual calendar for managing minor revisions (February to April)
