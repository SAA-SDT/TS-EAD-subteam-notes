# Workflow for engaging with new submissions to EAD3 repository on GitHub
This would be in combination with the annual calendar for minor revisions.

## Picking up on new submissions
- Team lead to keep track of new submissions in between the (monthly) meetings of the EAD team
  - Make sure email notifications are set for EAD3 repository as well as Tag Libraries repository
- Team lead to include brief comment of acknowledgement
  - Potentially indicate the date of the next meeting as an initial option for the EAD team to discuss
  - Check if submission has been made on behalf of someone else
    - If yes, send information (link to GitHub) to according email address 

## Inclusion in the agenda for the next team meeting
- Brief review and categorisation as either:
  - Bug (with the potential assignment to other teams to correct these bugs - schema and/or tag library)
  - Potential change/new feature as part of minor revision
  - Potential change/new feature as part of major revision
- Decide if further community input is necessary
  - If yes, prepare summary to be sent to EAD Listserv
  - If no, decide if further research/details are required and assign to one team member to prepare according analysis/input for (one of) the next meeting(s)

## After initial review
- Team lead to take note of team conversation (and potentially indicate next steps) in GitHub
- If decision was taken to ask for further community feedback, send according email to EAD Listserv
- If decision was taken to investigate further within the EAD team, have follow-up discussion in the next team meeting based on analysis by team member to whom the research was assigned

## Inclusion in annual calendar for minor revisions
- Finalise review in the context of preparing the annual minor revision
  - During January each year
  - Based on further community input (if it was requested and provided)
  - Based on further research done by one member of the EAD team and continued team discussion
- Include in next steps indicated in the annual calendar for managing minor revisions (February to April)
