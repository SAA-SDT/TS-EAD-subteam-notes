# Notes and To-dos on EAD1.1 release from meeting with TS-EAS Schema subteam on November 17, 2017

## To Dos:
- Have discussion with Mike about comment period expectations / mechanics
- Have discussion with Cory / Karin about Tag Library protocol during 12/14 documentation call
- Call EAD team meeting in late December, early January?

## EAD3 v1.1 release sequence:

**1. EAD3 1.1 Release Candidate**
  * Schema team and others will run final tests on 1.1 release candidate
  * Schema team will finalize EAD3 1.1 and issue a release candidate

**2. Run Comment Period**
  * Notify TS-EAS list that release is ready, comment period beginning, note changes in 1.1
  * TS EAS chairs will notify Standards Committee?
  * EAD subteam will coordinate, publicize, run comment period for at least one month after release of EAD3 1.1 release candidate
    * Publicize on EAD list, EAS Section list, elsewhere?
    * See Silkeâ€™s example message re: comment period for EAC-CPF
    * Include brief description of v1.1 changes with links to github issues
  * Comments can be submitted directly to Github (if commenters have accts) using Github issue template or emailed directly to Noah, who will compile in Github, hopefully by end of comment period

**3. Update EAD3 Tag Library**
  * Tag libraries exist as TEI: https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAS-TagLibraries/tree/master/tei
  * EAD subteam responsible for updating Tag Library, but documentation team executes changes in TEI and coordinates publication with LoC?
    * Have discussion with Cory Nimer and Karin about responsibilities here
    * QUESTION: Should EAD team edit TEI directly, or send updates in another format (e.g. Word?) to Documentation team to markup in TEI?
    * Documentation team will produce derivative versions for publication (HTML, PDF) on Library of Congress site
    * QUESTION: Documentation team will coordinate updates to other LoC pages?: https://www.loc.gov/ead/index.html
  * Old tag libraries will persist in HTML and PDF on LoC page, but will not be maintained in github; only maintain active EAD3 Tag Library
  * Schema changes in EAD3 1.1 will be called out in EAD3 1.1 release notes, but not distinguished in Tag Library
  * Tag Library should be up-to-date prior to official EAD3 1.1 release

**4. Finalize EAD3 1.1 release based on comments and publish updated Tag Library**
  * EAD3 team should discuss comments as they arrive, have discussion on Github issues, follow up with commenters, notify about decisions, incorporate changes if necessary
  * Formally release EAD v1.1 with updated Tag Library

**5. After successful release, formally document incremental release protocol** / responsibilities / timing for future TS-EAS members' sanity.

**6. Debrief on how to improve process**
