# Timeline for Annual EAD Revision Cycle - DRAFT

## August - December
- Open period for community to submit feature requests and bug reports for consideration in the next annual release.
- Submissions should follow [Github Issue template](https://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3/issues/new) and include justification for how the change will benefit the standard more broadly.
- TS-EAS will review and evaluate requests as they are received, seek additional information when necessary, and conduct discussion of requests in Github Issues.
- Where necessary, TS-EAS may seek broader community input on particular change requests via the EAD listserv and other outlets.

## December 31
- Deadline for receiving feature requests for inclusion in annual release.
- Feature requests received after this date may not be considered for inclusion in the annual release.

## January
- TS-EAS will issue a broad call for community feedback on any feature requests that are under consideration for the annual release. Feedback will be collected and made public in Github.

## February - April
- TS-EAS will make initial decision to accept or reject change requests based on the committeesâ€™ evaluation and community feedback. Decisions will be made public in Github. TS-EAS may decide to postpone evaluation of a request to the next cycle if it requires more discussion or community input.
- If there are no accepted change requests, TS-EAS may decide to forgo an annual release.
- If TS-EAS decides to issue a new release, it will clearly tag in Github which change requests it intends to include in the upcoming annual release.
- TS-EAS will submit the list of accepted change requests to the Standards Committee for approval
- After Standards Committee approval, TS-EAS will coordinate the work required to implement change requests in the EAD Schemas and tag libraries.
- TS-EAS will iteratively test new code branches including the changes.

## May - June
- TS-EAS will issue a Release Candidate including changes and solicit community testing and feedback.
- TS-EAS will run a ~6 week comment period to solicit feedback on the changes that are included in the RC.
- Comments should be documented in Github issues and made visible to community.
- TS-EAS will make any minor changes to the schema based on testing and feedback.
- TS-EAS will [update tag libraries](../blob/master/UPDATING.md) to reflect any changes to the schema

## July - August
- TS-EAS will finalize changes based on comments and testing and issue a new minor release (e.g. EAD3 v1.2.0). Target dates of annual release should coincide with SAA annual conference where possible.
- The minor release will include release notes clearly documenting the changes included in the release.
- TS-EAS will notify Standards Committee of pending release in advance of public announcement.
- TS-EAS will finalize tag libraries and coordinate publication of updated schemas and tag libraries with Library of Congress and Standards Committee.
- TS-EAS will publicize availability of new release on EAD listserv and other appropriate outlets and issue a call for additional change requests for the next annual revision cycle.

**Minor bug fixes may be reported / implemented outside of this review cycle.

**For major revisions to EAD that would have significant impacts on compatibility with the existing schema, TS-EAD would conduct more extensive community review and seek approval from Standards Committee and SAA Council. TS-EAS may choose to postpone the annual revision cycle while conducting a major revision.
